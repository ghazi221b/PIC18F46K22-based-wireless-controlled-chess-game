# PIC18F46K22-based-wireless-controlled-chess-game  
This was a fully practical implementation of a real "touchless" bluetooth-chess game  
Using a 2D axis controlled by stepper motors with a mounted electromagnet under the chess board we were able to fully move the peices to perform any actions  
The Micrcontroller was coded to keep track of the game and to allow legitmate actions, keep track of player moves and even check for win conditions  
Furthermore an added bluetooth component meant that any players could play the simply game by connecting their phones using any bluetooth application  
The final project boasted an easy to use interface coupled with a truly engaging game of chess that simultaneously obeyed SOPs
